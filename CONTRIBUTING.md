# Contributing

Are you interested in getting involved? I'm happy for you to raise issues and Pull Requests to correct documentation, bugs unbeknownst to me, or  improvements.

This is intended to be a learning experience, so issues raised which fundamentally change a problem space may not be accepted, sorry! 

## Do you have an idea for a problem space to solve?

Raise it as an issue - I'm always happy to hear suggestions. I find it difficult to come up with project ideas (this has resulted in countless unproductive hackathons...) so that would be a massive help to me at least!

Alternatively, if you don't know how to do what you would like to suggest, have a go yourself!

## Raising an Issue

Raise an issue as you see fit, but it would be a great help to add the problem space number or `IDEA` or `SUGGESTION` in the title.

### I found a problem, I should help this poor soul out and let him know...

Preferred Title format: `<Problem_Space_ID>: Spelling mistake in <file>`

Preferred Description format:
```
    <Problem_Space_Name>
    <Problem Description>
    <Suggested Corrections>
```

Example:

Title
> 01: Spelling Mistake in 01_serverless_architecture.md

Description
> 01_serverless_architecture
>
> Error on line 3: `Number Five`
>
> Should be `Number One`
>
> Reason: This is problem space 01, not 05!!
