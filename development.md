# Development

> I should preface this document by saying I am a Platform Engineer by profesion. Fair warning that there are almost definitely better alternatives to how I achieved functioning programs, as they are only intended for learning about Platform!

This document covers everything related to developing code for a platform. Each problem space is likely to have more content relating to and caused by their implementations. 

I know mutliple languages, and development principles, but we will see whether there is much crossover between problem spaces!
