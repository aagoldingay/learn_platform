# LEARN_PLATFORM

At the time of creating problem space 01, I have 3 years of experience as a Platform / Systems / DevOps Engineer, and 1 year of experience as a Software Engineer using C#.

Although I have enjoyed learning about Azure, I hold the belief that online services hosted in the cloud should be exist in multiple cloud providers concurrently. Meaning, should Azure have an outage, the service remains operational thanks to hosting in AWS as well. I have come to refer to platforms achieving this as being "cloud agnostic". A quick Google search shows I'm not the only one!

I intend for this repository to be a playground to advance my practical knowledge of Platform Engineering using multiple cloud providers, since I have, thus far, lacked the professional opportunities to deep dive the likes of AWS or GCP.

I hope my own learnings could be of use to anyone curious about Platform Engineering, or how to make things work "cloud agnostically"!

## Requirements

Each 'problem space' should fulfill the following requirements:

- Be specific.
    - A problem should be well defined, with a purposefully small scope.
- Be automated.
    - Use various tools to streamline development, deployment and resource management.
- Be reproducible.
    - Anyone should be able to run the developed solutions.
    - Achieve the like-for-like results, when starting from scratch.
- Be well documented
    - Each problem should contain as much documentation as possible 
        - to use as a personal knowledge base for reference.
        - to be a learning tool for any interested party.
    - and honest
        - Explain problems, solutions and experiences
    - and well written.
- Be "cloud agnostic"
    - Where possible.

## Problem Directories

## Documents

These pages contain generic and hopefully useful information that concerns more than one of the above problems.
